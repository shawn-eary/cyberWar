# Introduction
My name is Shawn Eary. I am a beginning Bachelor of Arts in Music student at University of Arkansas. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Cameron University of Lawton, OK. I work in Information Technology for my day job.

# Disclaimer
I seriously need to clean this credits file up. I Hope I get to that in a reasonable time frame. I do not mean to offend anyone "especially my daughters" with this project. The sheep sigh was written before I had an idea to make a music video out of this. While working on the video, I missed my daughters very much so I wanted to fit then in where I could. I had bigger plans for then like flying my daughters in on a US Flag and having my daughters carpet bomb communist rack servers with hearts, angels (drawn by my oldest), and an R2D2 that was drawn by my middle child, but I didn't get that far on Version1. Maybe someday I can get back to this. Right now, I really need to concentrate on getting the credits right.

I had talked to Sean Lucero of SpaceFunkTronia a bit about music videos and he suggested I used WinAmp and Milkdrop presets. Since I was on a GNU\Linux platform it was easier for me to use ProjectM. \

# Disclaimer
The political/religious views expressed in the Cyber War music and video do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone cited. In particular, University of Arkansas and Dr. Jacob Hertzog functioned as agents of learning so it would be reckless to assume that they either agree or disagree with my views.

It would be irresponsible for anyone to assume that mere attribution in the context of this project implies association. Please respect all cited individuals understanding that they have a right their own religious and political beliefs that may or may not differ from mine.

# Errors
I apologize for any errors I may have made in this file or anyone whom I may have missed. It is not by desire to shortchange anyone. Rather, I want the noble, kind and sometimes revolutionary artists who made quality work to be honored for the contributions they have made to mankind in the areas of Science Fiction, Gaming and or STEAM.
