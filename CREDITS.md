# Disclaimer
The political/religious views expressed in the Cyber War music and video do not necessarily reflect the views of anyone cited. In particular, University of Arkansas and Dr. Jacob Hertzog functioned as agents of learning so it would be reckless to assume that they either agree or disagree with my views.

It would be irresponsible for anyone to assume that mere attribution in the context of this project implies association. Please respect all cited individuals understanding that they have a right their own religious and political beliefs that may or may not differ from mine.

# Errors
I apologize for any errors I may have made in this file or anyone whom I may have missed. It is not by desire to shortchange anyone. Rather, I want the noble, kind and sometimes revolutionary artists who made quality work to be honored for the contributions they have made to mankind in the areas of Science Fiction, Gaming and or STEAM.
