## Verse1
Nintendo was Great it was such fun
Kept us from gettin burnt by the sun
Commodore Amiga was also a friend
she was so simple and easy to tend
Video games kept us "alive"
we had no need to go outside
Little did we know a monster would grow
to entrap us and put us in tow

## Verse2
Virtual Reality was our dream
but it was much closer than we seen

Micro PCs to hold in our hands
zombies staring at them in a trace
Media to tell us about each disease
just stay inside don't go out please
Now we can see what really controls
heartless machines to steal our souls

## Chorus
Cyberwar – Cyberwar
How could we know - What was in store
Cyberwar - Cyberwar
The men in blank - knocking at our doors
What did we do - What did we say?
Censorship is comin’ is on its way
We took of our masks and ripped out our chips
machine control will quantum our bits

## Bridge
(Guitar Solo Starts Here and Continues Until The End)
We are the programs. We are the programs
Being controlled by machines
We are the programs. We are the programs
Being crammed with nasty vaccines
